                <h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>Requesting a loan is easy with LendEtc.co. Fill out one easy form on LendEtc.co and your inquiry will be submitted to our large network of lenders. Loan amounts range from $100 to $5,000 (exact amounts vary based on lender programs and your state of residence). You can have a response from one of our lenders the same day, and often within minutes. Once your loan is approved, you will be redirected to the lender's website where you can review the terms of the loan, including details about all the applicable rates and fees. If you accept these terms, the lender will deposit money directly into your bank account as quickly as the next day.</p>
<p><strong>Most lenders have the following requirements to be approved:</strong></p>
<p>To be accepted by most lenders in our network, you should:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Be employed at your present job for at least 90 days.</li>
    <li>Be a US citizen or a permanent resident, and over the age of 18.</li>
    <li>Have an income of around $1,000 per month after tax deductions.</li>
    <li>Have a checking account in your name.</li>
    <li>Provide a working telephone number for your home and work.</li>
    <li>Provide a valid email address.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick Inquiry Process</h2>
<p>Through our secure technology, we will find a lender in our network that is willing to take work with you based on the information you submit. Once we have a lender ready to work with you, that lender will contact you to get any additional information they might need (such as verification of employment, pay stubs, etc.).</p>
<h2>Cash Sent Directly to You</h2>
<p>After your lender has taken and approved your request, cash will be deposited directly into your bank account. That means you don’t have to take a trip to the bank to endorse and deposit a check or pay check-cashing fees.</p>
<h2>Private and Secure</h2>
<p>We use industry-recognized security and advanced encryption technology to protect your personal information.</p>
<h2>Automated Repayment</h2>
<p>If you authorize your lender to take payment via automatic withdrawals (known as "ACH transfers"), then your loan payments will be paid automatically directly from your bank account. This means each payment will be on time and you won’t have to worry about missing any payments or incurring any late fees.</p>
<h2>Late Payments</h2>
<p>Late payment policies can differ among lenders. Please make sure you read and understand the loan agreement and your lender’s late payment policy before accepting the loan. In some states, late fees may be limited by law. In other states, late payments may allow the lender to charge late fees and may accelerate the loan making it due in full immediately.</p>
<p>NOTE: Before agreeing to a loan, please make sure you can make your loan payments in full and on time. We support the responsible use of loans and recognize that nobody knows your situation better than you.</p>
<h2>Loan Extensions</h2>
<p>State law may limit or prohibit a lender’s ability to extend or "roll over" your loan. Consult with your lender if you need a loan extension.</p>
<h2>Loan Default</h2>
<p>If you can’t make your loan payments on time, you may be in default of your loan obligations. Late payments and loan defaults may adversely affect your credit and may make it difficult to obtain future loans.</p>

    <p><strong>Important Disclosures. Please Read Carefully.</strong></p>
    <p>
        The purpose of shorter duration loans is to provide the borrower temporary financial relief. Such loans are not a long-term financial solution. Persons facing serious financial difficulties should consider other alternatives or should seek out professional financial advice.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website is not an offer to lend.
        LendEtc.co is not a lender and does not make loan or credit decisions.
        LendEtc.co connects interested persons with a lender from its network of approved lenders.
        LendEtc.co does not control and is not responsible for the actions or inactions of any lender, is not an agent, representative or broker of any lender, and does not endorse any lender.
        LendEtc.co receives compensation from its lenders, often based on a ping-tree model similar to Google AdWords where the highest available bidder is connected to the consumer.
        Regardless, LendEtc.co’s service is always free to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        This service is not available in all states.
        If you request a loan in a particular state where such loans are prohibited, or in a location where LendEtc.co does not have an available lender, you will not be connected to a lender.
        In some cases, you may be given the option of obtaining a loan from a tribal lender.
        Tribal lenders are subject to tribal and certain federal laws while being immune from state law including usury caps.
        If you are connected to a tribal lender, please understand that the tribal lender’s rates and fees may be higher than state-licensed lenders.
        Additionally, tribal lenders may require you to agree to resolve any disputes in a tribal jurisdiction.
        You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        LendEtc.co may pull your credit or look at your creditworthiness, but responsible lenders will.
        By submitting your information to LendEtc.co, you are giving lenders in LendEtc.co’s network permission to verify your social security number, driver license number or other identification, and to review your creditworthiness by pulling your credit history from major credit bureaus such as Experian, Equifax and Trans Union and from alternative credit bureaus such as Teletrack or DP Bureau.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Lender’s Disclosure of Terms.</strong></p>
    <p>The lender you are connected to will provide documents that contain all fees and rate information pertaining to the loan being offered, including any potential fees for late-payments and the rules under which you may be allowed (if permitted by applicable law) to refinance, renew or rollover your loan. Loan fees and interest rates are determined solely by the lender based on the lender’s internal policies, underwriting criteria and applicable law. LendEtc.co has no knowledge of or control over the loan terms offered by a lender. You are urged to read and understand the terms of any loan offered by any lender, whether tribal or state-licensed, and to reject any particular loan offer that you cannot afford to repay or that includes terms that are not acceptable to you.</p>
    <p><strong>Late Payments Hurt Your Credit Score</strong></p>
    <p>
        Please be aware that missing a payment or making a late payment can negatively impact your credit score.
        To protect yourself and your credit history, make sure you only accept loan terms that you can afford to repay.
        If you cannot make a payment on time, you should contact your lender immediately and discuss how to handle late payments.
